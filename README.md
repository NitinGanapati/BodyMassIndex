# BMI Calculator

A Flutter application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height.

- **Dynamic UI**: The background color changes based on the BMI result:
  - **Healthy**: Green
  - **Overweight**: Orange
  - **Underweight**: Red
- **Input Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled before calculation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design using Material 3.

## How It Works
